### **Phase 1: Bitlayer PoS — Laying the Foundation**

In this foundational phase, Bitlayer adopts a cutting-edge security model that combines Proof of Stake (PoS) with multisignature (multisig) technology, ensuring robust protection for assets. By collaborating with multiple MPC (Multi-Party Computation) custody platforms, Bitlayer establishes a secure and scalable infrastructure while maintaining 100% EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) compatibility to onboard both users and developers seamlessly.  

Bitlayer PoS introduces cross-chain functionality, enabling smooth asset movement between Bitcoin (BTC), EVM-based blockchains, and other networks. This interoperability enriches the Bitlayer ecosystem, fostering a dynamic environment for innovation and growth.  

During this stage, the focus is on empowering developers with a fully EVM-compatible development toolkit and comprehensive ecosystem support. Developers can quickly build, test, and deploy decentralized applications (dApps) on Bitlayer, with Solidity applications migrating effortlessly. Early adopters benefit from ultra-low gas fees and an extensible framework built on Bitcoin, paving the way for a thriving developer and user community.

### **Phase 2: Native Bitcoin Rollup — Pioneering Bitcoin Security**

**Target: Q1/Q2 2025**

This phase marks a transformative leap as Bitlayer evolves into a native Bitcoin rollup, achieving Bitcoin-equivalent security by verifying Layer 2 state transitions directly on Bitcoin. This innovation ensures trustless, robust security for all transactions.

Highlights of this phase include:

- **Trust-Minimized BTC Bridge**: A groundbreaking bridge replaces the multisig-based solution from Phase 1, delivering enhanced decentralization and security.
- **Seamless Migration**: Applications transition effortlessly from Bitlayer PoS to the rollup architecture, ensuring continuity and zero disruptions for developers and users.

By anchoring its security to Bitcoin, Bitlayer establishes itself as a leader in trust-minimized blockchain solutions, setting a new standard for scalability and reliability.

### **Phase 3: Enhanced Bitlayer Rollup — Scaling to New Heights**

**Target: Q4 2025**

The final stage of the roadmap focuses on performance, scalability, and user experience. Bitlayer achieves unprecedented throughput and responsiveness, making it a powerhouse for high-volume on-chain activity.

Key advancements include:

- **Unmatched Performance**: Bitlayer reaches a staggering throughput of 20,000 transactions per second (TPS), enabling enterprise-grade applications and mass adoption.
- **Lightning-Fast Confirmations**: Transactions achieve soft confirmation within just 3 seconds, providing a seamless, near-instant user experience.

With these enhancements, Bitlayer positions itself as the ultimate platform for high-performance blockchain applications, merging Bitcoin's security with unparalleled scalability and efficiency.

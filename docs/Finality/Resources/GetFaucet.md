# How to get Test Token


## What is a Crypto Faucet?

Testnets are networks that simulate the execution environments of blockchain mainnets but do not offer the same level of security and decentralization.

Crypto testnet faucets provide testnet tokens to smart contract developers, enabling them to deploy, test, and optimize their smart contracts on testnets without incurring high gas fees.

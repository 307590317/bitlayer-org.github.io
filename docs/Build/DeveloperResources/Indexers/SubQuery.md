## Intro

SubQuery is a leading blockchain data indexer that provides developers with fast, flexible, universal, open source and decentralised APIs for web3 projects. SubQuery SDK allows developers to get rich indexed data and build intuitive and immersive decentralised applications in a faster and more efficient way. SubQuery supports 200+ ecosystems including Bitlayer, Polygon zkEVM, Polygon Amoy, Ethereum, Polkadot, Algorand, NEAR, and Avalanche.

Another one of SubQueryâ€™s competitive advantages is the ability to aggregate data not only within a chain but across multiple blockchains all within a single project. This allows the creation of feature-rich dashboard analytics and multi-chain block scanners.

Other advantages include superior performance with multiple RPC endpoint configurations, multi-worker capabilities and a configurable caching architecture. To find out more, visit our [documentation](https://academy.subquery.network/).

## Getting Started

Take a look at this SubQuery Starter Project that introduces SubQuery's Bitlayer support by indexing [Bitlayer](https://github.com/subquery/ethereum-subql-starter/tree/main/Bitlayer/bitlayer-starter).

You can also follow along this [step by step guide](https://academy.subquery.network/quickstart/quickstart.html) to get familiar with SubQuery.

## Running and Hosting your Bitlayer SubQuery APIs

SubQuery is open-source, meaning you have the freedom to run it in the following three ways:
- Locally on your own computer (or a cloud provider of your choosing), [view the instructions on how to run SubQuery Locally](https://academy.subquery.network/run_publish/run.html).
- You can publish it to enterprise-level [Hosting Providers](https://academy.subquery.network/indexer/run_publish/introduction.html#other-hosting-providers-in-the-subquery-community).
- You can publish it to the decentralised [SubQuery Network](https://app.subquery.network/), the most open, performant, reliable, and scalable data service for dApp developers. The SubQuery Network indexes and services data to the global community in an incentivised and verifiable way and supports Bitlayer from launch.
